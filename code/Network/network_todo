    nick  0) state enum: eg. { waiting for first client to hit go, playing, showing who won, ... }
So far this has taken the form of the loops in scheduler.cpp
          
 youlian  1)  Packet format
enum for header in place
          
    nick  2)  client::pushToServer()
          3)  server::updateFromClient()
          
 youlian  4)  server::pushToClient()
          5)  client::updateFromServer()
          
    nick  code is pretty ugly and probably not well error checked
