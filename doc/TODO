splash screen?
    this will require making some kind of graphics animation, and additionally
    writing code that allows for some rendering to occur before the game
    actually begins.
    Jordan drew a mockup of a splash screen idea here:

Schedule time to all code
 clean up bad stuff, add stuff with support

2D code
 widgets, for example HUD, speedometer
 menu

Objects/Meshes
 try Reppy's obj loader

Track files
 starting player positions

Looking good
 shader loading
 skybox
 glow
 
Handling
 not flipping over (check and fix)
 suspension (tilt during turns)

get rid of test setups
 position ai/human cars
 turn into command-line or menu
 number of human players, number of ai agents

Game states
 showing 3..2..1.. screen
 waiting for clients
 transitions
  from menu to non-menu
  countdown to start
  waiting for network
 implementation
  objects
  switches
  n^2 transition table

Try this:

Scheduler
 initialize everything
 while(1)
   switch (state)
     case starting:
       ...
     case playing:
       physics.go
       input.go
     case pause:
       ...
     case menu:
