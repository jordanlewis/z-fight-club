This file should hold issues to be discussed at our soonest
convenience, either after class meeting or when we're all on IRC.

--------------------------------------------------------
Unified error handling system.
 ala syslog, with priority and facility (Jordan)

Asset handling: SDL_image, SDL_sound, SDL_RWops, PhysicsFS?
 getopts, option for asset directory, track file

Networking:
 Nick: look into enet and SDL_net
 Youlian: check out SDL_net

Testing:
 cleanup/rename racer.cpp, pull out world/agent configuration
 so different devs can use different configs at build-time

by Apr 27:
 getopts (Nick)
 track with constraining walls, in good view of camera (Joe, Jordan)
 ai that can try to round the track (Joe, Jordan)
 car trails, (past and future) (Joe, Matt)
